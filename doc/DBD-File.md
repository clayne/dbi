# NAME

DBD::File - Base class for writing file based DBI drivers

# SYNOPSIS

This module is a base class for writing other [DBD](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI%3A%3ADBD)s.
It is not intended to function as a DBD itself (though it is possible).
If you want to access flat files, use [DBD::AnyData](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3AAnyData), or
[DBD::CSV](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3ACSV) (both of which are subclasses of DBD::File).

# DESCRIPTION

The DBD::File module is not a true [DBI](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI) driver, but an abstract
base class for deriving concrete DBI drivers from it. The implication
is, that these drivers work with plain files, for example CSV files or
INI files. The module is based on the [SQL::Statement](https://metacpan.org/pod/SQL%3A%3AStatement)
module, a simple SQL engine.

See [DBI](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI) for details on DBI, [SQL::Statement](https://metacpan.org/pod/SQL%3A%3AStatement) for
details on SQL::Statement and [DBD::CSV](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3ACSV), [DBD::DBM](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3ADBM)
or [DBD::AnyData](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3AAnyData) for example drivers.

## Metadata

The following attributes are handled by DBI itself and not by DBD::File,
thus they all work as expected:

    Active
    ActiveKids
    CachedKids
    CompatMode             (Not used)
    InactiveDestroy
    AutoInactiveDestroy
    Kids
    PrintError
    RaiseError
    Warn                   (Not used)

### The following DBI attributes are handled by DBD::File:

#### AutoCommit

Always on.

#### ChopBlanks

Works.

#### NUM\_OF\_FIELDS

Valid after `$sth->execute`.

#### NUM\_OF\_PARAMS

Valid after `$sth->prepare`.

#### NAME

Valid after `$sth->execute`; undef for Non-Select statements.

#### NULLABLE

Not really working, always returns an array ref of ones, except the
affected table has been created in this session.  Valid after
`$sth->execute`; undef for non-select statements.

### Unsupported DBI attributes and methods

- bind\_param\_inout
- CursorName
- LongReadLen
- LongTruncOk

### DBD::File specific attributes

In addition to the DBI attributes, you can use the following dbh
attributes:

#### f\_dir

This attribute is used for setting the directory where the files are
opened and it defaults to the current directory (`.`). Usually you set
it on the dbh but it may be overridden per table (see [f\_meta](https://metacpan.org/pod/f_meta)).

When the value for `f_dir` is a relative path, it is converted into
the appropriate absolute path name (based on the current working
directory) when the dbh attribute is set.

    f_dir => "/data/foo/csv",

If `f_dir` is set to a non-existing location, the connection will fail.
See CVE-2014-10401 for reasoning. Because of this, folders to use cannot
be created after the connection, but must exist before the connection is
initiated.

See ["KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"](#known-bugs-and-limitations).

#### f\_dir\_search

This optional attribute can be set to pass a list of folders to also
find existing tables. It will **not** be used to create new files.

    f_dir_search => [ "/data/bar/csv", "/dump/blargh/data" ],

#### f\_ext

This attribute is used for setting the file extension. The format is:

    extension{/flag}

where the /flag is optional and the extension is case-insensitive.
`f_ext` allows you to specify an extension which:

    f_ext => ".csv/r",

- makes DBD::File prefer `table.extension` over `table`.
- makes the table name the filename minus the extension.

    DBI:CSV:f_dir=data;f_ext=.csv

In the above example and when `f_dir` contains both `table.csv` and
`table`, DBD::File will open `table.csv` and the table will be
named "table". If `table.csv` does not exist but `table` does
that file is opened and the table is also called "table".

If `f_ext` is not specified and `table.csv` exists it will be opened
and the table will be called "table.csv" which is probably not what
you want.

NOTE: even though extensions are case-insensitive, table names are
not.

    DBI:CSV:f_dir=data;f_ext=.csv/r

The `r` flag means the file extension is required and any filename
that does not match the extension is ignored.

Usually you set it on the dbh but it may be overridden per table
(see [f\_meta](https://metacpan.org/pod/f_meta)).

#### f\_schema

This will set the schema name and defaults to the owner of the
directory in which the table file resides. You can set `f_schema` to
`undef`.

    my $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:CSV:", "", "", {
        f_schema => undef,
        f_dir    => "data",
        f_ext    => ".csv/r",
        }) or die $DBI::errstr;

By setting the schema you affect the results from the tables call:

    my @tables = $dbh->tables ();

    # no f_schema
    "merijn".foo
    "merijn".bar

    # f_schema => "dbi"
    "dbi".foo
    "dbi".bar

    # f_schema => undef
    foo
    bar

Defining `f_schema` to the empty string is equal to setting it to `undef`
so the DSN can be `"dbi:CSV:f_schema=;f_dir=."`.

#### f\_lock

The `f_lock` attribute is used to set the locking mode on the opened
table files. Note that not all platforms support locking.  By default,
tables are opened with a shared lock for reading, and with an
exclusive lock for writing. The supported modes are:

    0: No locking at all.

    1: Shared locks will be used.

    2: Exclusive locks will be used.

But see [KNOWN BUGS](#known-bugs-and-limitations) below.

#### f\_lockfile

If you wish to use a lockfile extension other than `.lck`, simply specify
the `f_lockfile` attribute:

    $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:DBM:f_lockfile=.foo");
    $dbh->{f_lockfile} = ".foo";
    $dbh->{dbm_tables}{qux}{f_lockfile} = ".foo";

If you wish to disable locking, set the `f_lockfile` to `0`.

    $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:DBM:f_lockfile=0");
    $dbh->{f_lockfile} = 0;
    $dbh->{dbm_tables}{qux}{f_lockfile} = 0;

#### f\_encoding

With this attribute, you can set the encoding in which the file is opened.
This is implemented using `binmode $fh, ":encoding(<f_encoding>)"`.

#### f\_meta

Private data area aliasing ["sql\_meta" in DBI::DBD::SqlEngine](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI%3A%3ADBD%3A%3ASqlEngine#sql_meta) which
contains information about the tables this module handles. Table meta
data might not be available until the table has been accessed for the
first time e.g., by issuing a select on it however it is possible to
pre-initialize attributes for each table you use.

DBD::File recognizes the (public) attributes `f_ext`, `f_dir`,
`f_file`, `f_encoding`, `f_lock`, `f_lockfile`, `f_schema`,
in addition to the attributes ["sql\_meta" in DBI::DBD::SqlEngine](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI%3A%3ADBD%3A%3ASqlEngine#sql_meta) already
supports. Be very careful when modifying attributes you do not know,
the consequence might be a destroyed or corrupted table.

`f_file` is an attribute applicable to table meta data only and you
will not find a corresponding attribute in the dbh. Whilst it may be
reasonable to have several tables with the same column names, it is
not for the same file name. If you need access to the same file using
different table names, use `SQL::Statement` as the SQL engine and the
`AS` keyword:

    SELECT * FROM tbl AS t1, tbl AS t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id

`f_file` can be an absolute path name or a relative path name but if
it is relative, it is interpreted as being relative to the `f_dir`
attribute of the table meta data. When `f_file` is set DBD::File will
use `f_file` as specified and will not attempt to work out an
alternative for `f_file` using the `table name` and `f_ext`
attribute.

While `f_meta` is a private and readonly attribute (which means, you
cannot modify it's values), derived drivers might provide restricted
write access through another attribute. Well known accessors are
`csv_tables` for [DBD::CSV](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3ACSV), `ad_tables` for [DBD::AnyData](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3AAnyData) and
`dbm_tables` for [DBD::DBM](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3ADBM).

### New opportunities for attributes from DBI::DBD::SqlEngine

#### sql\_table\_source

`$dbh->{sql_table_source}` can be set to
_DBD::File::TableSource::FileSystem_ (and is the default setting
of DBD::File). This provides usual behaviour of previous DBD::File
releases on

    @ary = DBI->data_sources ($driver);
    @ary = DBI->data_sources ($driver, \%attr);

    @ary = $dbh->data_sources ();
    @ary = $dbh->data_sources (\%attr);

    @names = $dbh->tables ($catalog, $schema, $table, $type);

    $sth = $dbh->table_info ($catalog, $schema, $table, $type);
    $sth = $dbh->table_info ($catalog, $schema, $table, $type, \%attr);

    $dbh->func ("list_tables");

#### sql\_data\_source

`$dbh->{sql_data_source}` can be set to either
_DBD::File::DataSource::File_, which is default and provides the
well known behavior of DBD::File releases prior to 0.41, or
_DBD::File::DataSource::Stream_, which reuses already opened
file-handle for operations.

### Internally private attributes to deal with SQL backends

Do not modify any of these private attributes unless you understand
the implications of doing so. The behavior of DBD::File and derived
DBDs might be unpredictable when one or more of those attributes are
modified.

#### sql\_nano\_version

Contains the version of loaded DBI::SQL::Nano.

#### sql\_statement\_version

Contains the version of loaded SQL::Statement.

#### sql\_handler

Contains either the text 'SQL::Statement' or 'DBI::SQL::Nano'.

#### sql\_ram\_tables

Contains optionally temporary tables.

#### sql\_flags

Contains optional flags to instantiate the SQL::Parser parsing engine
when SQL::Statement is used as SQL engine. See [SQL::Parser](https://metacpan.org/pod/SQL%3A%3AParser) for valid
flags.

## Driver private methods

### Default DBI methods

#### data\_sources

The `data_sources` method returns a list of subdirectories of the current
directory in the form "dbi:CSV:f\_dir=$dirname".

If you want to read the subdirectories of another directory, use

    my ($drh)  = DBI->install_driver ("CSV");
    my (@list) = $drh->data_sources (f_dir => "/usr/local/csv_data");

### Additional methods

The following methods are only available via their documented name when
DBD::File is used directly. Because this is only reasonable for testing
purposes, the real names must be used instead. Those names can be computed
by replacing the `f_` in the method name with the driver prefix.

#### f\_versions

Signature:

    sub f_versions (;$)
    {
      my ($table_name) = @_;
      $table_name ||= ".";
      ...
      }

Returns the versions of the driver, including the DBI version, the Perl
version, DBI::PurePerl version (if DBI::PurePerl is active) and the version
of the SQL engine in use.

    my $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:File:");
    my $f_versions = $dbh->func ("f_versions");
    print "$f_versions\n";
    __END__
    # DBD::File              0.41 using IO::File (1.16)
    #   DBI::DBD::SqlEngine  0.05 using SQL::Statement 1.406
    # DBI                    1.623
    # OS                     darwin (12.2.1)
    # Perl                   5.017006 (darwin-thread-multi-ld-2level)

Called in list context, f\_versions will return an array containing each
line as single entry.

Some drivers might use the optional (table name) argument and modify
version information related to the table (e.g. DBD::DBM provides storage
backend information for the requested table, when it has a table name).

# KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

- This module uses flock () internally but flock is not available on all
platforms. On MacOS and Windows 95 there is no locking at all (perhaps
not so important on MacOS and Windows 95, as there is only a single
user).
- The module stores details about the handled tables in a private area
of the driver handle (`$drh`). This data area is not shared between
different driver instances, so several `DBI->connect ()` calls will
cause different table instances and private data areas.

    This data area is filled for the first time when a table is accessed,
    either via an SQL statement or via `table_info` and is not
    destroyed until the table is dropped or the driver handle is released.
    Manual destruction is possible via [f\_clear\_meta](https://metacpan.org/pod/f_clear_meta).

    The following attributes are preserved in the data area and will
    evaluated instead of driver globals:

    - f\_ext
    - f\_dir
    - f\_dir\_search
    - f\_lock
    - f\_lockfile
    - f\_encoding
    - f\_schema
    - col\_names
    - sql\_identifier\_case

    The following attributes are preserved in the data area only and
    cannot be set globally.

    - f\_file

    The following attributes are preserved in the data area only and are
    computed when initializing the data area:

    - f\_fqfn
    - f\_fqbn
    - f\_fqln
    - table\_name

    For DBD::CSV tables this means, once opened "foo.csv" as table named "foo",
    another table named "foo" accessing the file "foo.txt" cannot be opened.
    Accessing "foo" will always access the file "foo.csv" in memorized
    `f_dir`, locking `f_lockfile` via memorized `f_lock`.

    You can use [f\_clear\_meta](https://metacpan.org/pod/f_clear_meta) or the `f_file` attribute for a specific table
    to work around this.

- When used with SQL::Statement and temporary tables e.g.,

        CREATE TEMP TABLE ...

    the table data processing bypasses DBD::File::Table. No file system
    calls will be made and there are no clashes with existing (file based)
    tables with the same name. Temporary tables are chosen over file
    tables, but they will not covered by `table_info`.
